# IBM x3650 Port notes: This port was made in an attempt to quiet down an IBM system x3650 M4.
#                       The porting involved changing the raw commands, removing the get GetFanRPM as it was
#                           useless in my scenario and IBM lists their fans as 1A 1B 2A 2B.
#                       Also the imm2 mantains a partial control over the fans actual speed, for example setting
#                           the fans at 30% result in an actual fan speed of roughly 24%, sometimes the script
#                           fails to update and the imm2 takes control back over the fans speed controls. 
#                       Overall the real speed settings feels very coarse.

# This script controls IPMI compatible server's fan speeds in response to CPU Temperatures provided by lm-sensors.
# This script has been tested on a Dell PowerEdge R210 II, but should work on any IPMI compatible server.
#
# NOTE: The script puts your server into "Full Fan Speed Mode", and then modifies what "Full Speed" means,
#       You have to manually use IPMI to set it to e.g. "Optimal" when you're not using the script.
#
# NOTE: You use this script at your own risk, and no warranty is provided. Do not use in produciton environments.

# What's new?
#
# The original script provided a "step" approach where fans would take large "steps" depending on the temps.
# In this version, scalar equations are generated to provide an easy (and quiet) slope to follow to the next step.
# These equations are simple Y=mx+b linear slopes that effectivly provide a fan "curve" based on the entries in the
# %cpu_temp_to_fan_speed hash table.
#
# More documentation is planned, however I am available to answer basic configuration questions in the mean time.
